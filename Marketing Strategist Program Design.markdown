  - Query input field for natural language questions.
  - Results display with options to download or share.

## Example Workflow

1. **Upload**: The strategist uploads 150 presentations for a client via the web app.
2. **Extraction**: `data_extraction.py` processes each file, extracting text and metadata.
3. **Storage**: `database.py` stores text, metadata, and embeddings in the database.
4. **Query**: The strategist asks, “Summarize Client X’s campaign goals.”
5. **Agent**: `agent.py` uses langgraph to:
   - Query the database for relevant slides.
   - Generate a summary using GPT-4o-mini.
6. **Display**: The web app shows the summary, with options to download or refine the query.

## Potential Challenges

- **File Format Variability**: Older .ppt files or non-standard formats may require additional processing.
- **Data Volume**: Processing 150 presentations per client requires efficient batch handling and storage.
- **Cost**: OpenAI API and cloud hosting costs must be monitored, especially for large-scale use.
